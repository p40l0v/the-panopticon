          <h3>For ages disciplinary power manifested in brute force; imprisonment was just a transitional phase between violent interrogation and even more violent punishment. The birth of the modern culture in the 19th century and the emergence of a more humane societal discourse have had a very tangible effect on people’s bodies. </h3>
          <h2 id="subtitle">  The innovation of disciplinary power is all brought together in a single architectural innovation. </h2>

              <p class="point" id="p0">The principles of this oppressive system are: </p>
                <div class="subrpinciples">
                  <p class="point" id="p1">  <strong>Spatialization: <br> </strong>a place for everyone/ everyone in their place.</p>
                  <p class="point" id="p2">  <strong>Time Controlled Activity:<br> </strong>excessive use of timetables without an option of an individual adjustments.</p>
                  <p class="point" id="p3">  <strong>Repetitive Exercises:<br> </strong>sufficient repetition creates automatic reactions to stimuli.</p>
                  <p class="point" id="p4">  <strong>Detailed Hierarchies:<br> </strong>each level of the hierarchy keeps watch over the lower ranks.</p>
                  <p class="point" id="p5"> <strong> Normalizing Judgements:<br></strong> constant analysis of the disciplined one’s deviation from normality. Deviation is not only negative but also (much worse!) abnormal.</p>

            </div>
          <p class="left">The structure of the panopticon is rather simple and genius at that: every inmate is isolated in their own small cell/ room, where they all may be observed by a single disciplinary at the center of the watch tower. All the
            cells are well lit for the observers’ advantage yet they can not see if, when or by whom they are being examined.
            As the prisoner (student? patient? employee?)  becomes better behaved, less argumentative, more cooperative, they could be gradually introduced to new privileges, like freedom, recommendation, permanent job contract, etc.
          </p>

        <h2 class="question"> Q: if the prison indeed succeeds in reengineering the individual through this process, what kind of person comes out of this apparatus?</h2>
