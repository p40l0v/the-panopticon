        <div id="text">
          <h3>A: A docile worker who conveys the preassigned demands without questioning and struggle. It’s a person fully adjusted for automation — essential element of the Capitalist factory. </h3>
          <h2 id="subtitle"> A core attribute of a penal system -a panopticon prison- is that it’s successfully tweaked to perform as an individual engineering tool. </h2>
          <h2> This science develops in the army, schools, hospitals, psychiatric hospitals (mad houses) poorhouses and factories. </h2>
          <p class="left">As Hegel concluded, laboring doesn’t make the prisoner free. They are still imprisoned through labor. In the post-modern society though the master is also forced to work. Today's dialectic of master and slave means the
            totalization of labor.
            Today, everyone is an auto–exploiting laborer in their own micro–enterprise. We are masters and slaves in one, the inner struggle has replaced the traditional class struggle. There is no working class being exploited by the bourgeois with
            the means of production. This happens due to the immaterial means of production.
          </p>
          <h2>This new system is so efficiency–driven, that exploitation had to become self–driven. It’s a  system of exploiting freedom.</h2>
          <h3> Everything that belongs to practices and expressive forms of liberty — emotion, play, and communication — comes to be exploited: with maximized freedom comes maximized returns. <h3>
          <p class="left"> Through this mechanism, it becomes very problematic if ever possible to form any protectionist political power representing “the ordinary man”. People perceiving themselves as failures in the neoliberal achievement society see themselves as entirely responsible and ashamed instead of questioning society or the system. It is uncustomary to admit your failings, it would automatically imply one’s abnormality. This auto–aggression means that the exploited are not inclined to revolution so much as depression.
